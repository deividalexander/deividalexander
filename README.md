### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Senior Full Stack Developer** with over **6+ years of experience** building and scaling software systems, with a strong focus on **Python-based backends, APIs, and React frontends**. I hold a degree in **Computer Science Engineering** with a minor in **Marketing Analytics**, which allows me to align technical decisions with real business outcomes.

I don’t just write code — I **optimize processes and systems**.  
In a recent enterprise project, I **refactored and validated large-scale data pipelines**, improving architecture and performance while achieving **annual savings of over $188k USD**. This experience strengthened my ability to make technical decisions that directly impact cost, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

My background ranges from working as a **Senior Consultant at Pariveda Solutions**, supporting enterprise clients and large production systems, to leading projects as a **Freelance Senior Full Stack Engineer**, where I own the technical direction end-to-end: from discovery and architecture to delivery and deployment.

#### 🚀 What I Focus On
- Designing and developing **scalable backend systems** using **Python (FastAPI, Django, Flask)**
- Building modern, maintainable **frontend applications with React**
- Creating and integrating **REST APIs** with third-party platforms, CRMs, ERPs, and external services
- Improving system performance, reliability, and long-term scalability

---

#### 🧠 How I Work
- 📐 Strong experience in **Scrum / Agile** environments
- 🧼 Clean Code, clear architecture, and minimal technical debt
- 🧩 I translate business requirements into solid technical solutions
- 💬 Clear, proactive communication with stakeholders and teams

---

#### 🤝 What You Can Expect
- Ownership and accountability from day one
- Transparency around scope, risks, and trade-offs
- A partner who understands both **engineering and business priorities**

⚙️ I don’t just write code — I optimize processes and systems.
